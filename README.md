# osu! Miss Analyzer
A program to analyze misses in an osu! replay.

Credit for the beatmap and replay parsing and analysis code goes to [firedigger](https://github.com/firedigger) from his [osu! replay analyzer](https://github.com/firedigger/osuReplayAnalyzer).

## How To Use

Run the program. It'll ask you to select a replay file and beatmap.

After you select both of these, it'll analyze the misses and display them in an interactive window.
